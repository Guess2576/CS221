            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Connor Guess. I am an amateur photographer and college student from Chelsea, Alabama. I've pursued photography ever since I was 16 and took my first trip to Wyoming. The landscapes of Yellowstone captured my eye and ever since then I've had a passion for taking wildlife and landscape photos. Feel free to contact me regarding my work!</p>
